**In Jupyter Notebook using tensorflow:** <br>
**Step 1**: Download the Dataset from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VXInICY3Tw9yFmN6fTi5dT5vygovJRpT?usp=sharing <br>
  put the "input_folder" (1.8 GB) in the same folder as the "basketball_win_probability.ipynb" file. <br>
**Step 2**: Run the "basketball_win_probability.ipynb" file. <br>


**In Google colab using tensorflow:** <br>
**Step 1**: Download the Dataset from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VXInICY3Tw9yFmN6fTi5dT5vygovJRpT?usp=sharing <br>
  put the "input_folder" (1.8 GB) in the google drive and mount your google drive in google colab (using the same email id to login in google colab).
  Find the path of "input_folder" and edit the 2nd cell of "basketball_win_probability.ipynb" accordingly. <br>
**Step 2**: Run the "basketball_win_probability.ipynb" file. <br>

**IMP:**<br>
There are 3 parts inside "basketball_win_probability.ipynb" you can run part2 or part3 directly without needing to run previou parts by uncommenting the 3rd cell from the cell where that part starts. Part no is clearly mentioned as heading in the file.
